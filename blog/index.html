    <h2 id="beware">Beware</h2>

<p>Before diving on the topic, don’t forget that <code class="highlighter-rouge">Native</code>, in Elm, means writing JavaScript code called directly from Elm code. This has nothing to do with iOS or Android or stuff like React Native.</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning">Be super careful. The promise that Elm has no runtime error is broken the moment you start writing native code. If your native JavaScript code throws an error, it will crash your program. It’s up to you to ensure that it cannot happen, just like Elm does. <code class="highlighter-rouge">try/catch</code> is your best friend if you have any doubt.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-and-useless-example">A simple and useless example</h2>

<p>Let’s start with simple things. Let’s pretend for a brief moment that Elm does not have a function nor an operator to add integers. That kind of suck because you don’t want to write ports to achieve that, it should be synchronous, right? Your only solution is to write a native JavaScript function just like this one:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">a</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">b</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That was easy! Now, how do we plug it into our Elm code? First, we will need to wrap it inside a specific code to ensure that it will fit on the resulting JavaScript file after Elm compilation. I will talk about the syntax of this file on another blog post so, for now, just trust me on the syntax.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">_username$project$Native_Utils</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">a</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">b</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="na">add</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">F2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">add</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>What happened? Our code was so nice and now it’s nearly nonsense… Actually, it’s not that hard. Nearly all functions and constants in Elm will be assigned to a JavaScript variable in the compiled file. The name syntax is: <code class="highlighter-rouge">_[username]$[project name]$[module name]</code>. <code class="highlighter-rouge">username</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">project name</code> are both coming from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">repository</code> field inside your <code class="highlighter-rouge">elm-package.json</code>, most of the time it will be your GitHub username and the name of your project. If you don’t have this field, default values <code class="highlighter-rouge">username</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">project</code> will be used. So don’t forget to edit them to match your project.</p>

<p>Then we create an IIFE (aka a function that automatically called itself). That’s because we want to scope all our variables and functions. The returned value is an object exposing the API of our native module. Right now, we only have one function exposed but we could have way more.</p>

<p>Finally, because all functions in Elm are curried, we need to apply a small Elm helper to achieve that. You have several of them, from <code class="highlighter-rouge">F2</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">F9</code>, where the number match the number of arguments of your function. Since <code class="highlighter-rouge">add</code> has 2 arguments, we wrap it inside <code class="highlighter-rouge">F2</code>. There is no need to wrap functions with zero or one argument. We could also have directly wrote a curried function just like that:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">b</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">a</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">b</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>But the <code class="highlighter-rouge">F2</code> helper is easier.</p>

<p>Now, let’s save our code inside the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Native/Utils.js</code> file. That’s because we named our module <code class="highlighter-rouge">Native_Utils</code> (see the first line of the previous JavaScript code), and underscore means subfolder. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Native</code> part is mandatory but you can rename the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Utils</code> part as you want. Just be sure to also change the variable name at the beginning of the native code. We can now import it inside our Elm code and use it.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-elm" data-lang="elm"><span class="c1">-- This is a normal Elm module</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="c1">-- We are using the same Utils name but you don't have to</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="kr">module</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">Utils</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">exposing</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span>add<span class="p">)</span><span class="w">

</span><span class="c1">-- Importing the native code</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="c1">-- Beware, your code will compile even if you don't import it</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="c1">-- but will crash at runtime</span><span class="w">
</span>import <span class="kt">Native</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kt">Utils</span><span class="w">

</span><span class="c1">-- Creating an Elm function based on our native function</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="c1">-- Just like before, you don't have to use the same name</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="c1">-- but it's easier this way</span><span class="w">
</span>add<span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">Int</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">Int</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">Int</span><span class="w">
</span>add <span class="o">=</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="kt">Native</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kt">Utils</span><span class="p">.</span>add</code></pre></figure>

<p>This is a 200% danger zone. The Elm compiler is mostly like <em>“Oh, you are using native? Ok, I will fully trust you on what you are doing but don’t complain if the world ends when your program crashes.”</em> It means that the compiler will not perform any checks on types on any native function. For example, we could write:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-elm" data-lang="elm"><span class="kr">module</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">Utils</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">exposing</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span>addInt<span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span>addFloat<span class="p">)</span><span class="w">

</span>import <span class="kt">Native</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kt">Utils</span><span class="w">

</span>addInt<span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">Int</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">Int</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">Int</span><span class="w">
</span>addInt <span class="o">=</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="kt">Native</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kt">Utils</span><span class="p">.</span>add
<span class="w">
</span>addFloat<span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">Float</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">Float</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">Float</span><span class="w">
</span>addFloat <span class="o">=</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="kt">Native</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kt">Utils</span><span class="p">.</span>add</code></pre></figure>

<p>And it will work just fine. The compiler will not try to do any type inference on native code. It’s totally up to you to make sure it will actually produce the expected result at runtime.</p>

<p class="alert alert-info"><strong>Protip</strong> This is why you should <strong>always</strong> add an Elm signature to your native functions by writing a corresponding Elm function which just call it directly. Just like we did, feel free to create several Elm functions with different signatures if your native function can handle them just fine. But <strong>never</strong> write code mixing standard Elm code with a native call in the middle of it, it will be a pain to understand its signature, it will be hard to debug and it will be easier to break at runtime.</p>

<p>That’s it! You can now use your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Utils</code> module inside your Elm project.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-elm" data-lang="elm"><span class="kr">module</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">Main</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">exposing</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(..)</span><span class="w">

</span>import <span class="kt">Utils</span><span class="w">

</span><span class="kr">type</span><span class="w"> </span>alias <span class="kt">Model</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">Int</span><span class="w">

</span>init<span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">Model</span><span class="w">
</span>init <span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">Utils</span><span class="p">.</span>add <span class="m">40</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="m">2</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="lets-go-crazy">Let’s go crazy</h2>

<p>Obviously, you can write code that bends the limitations of Elm. All Elm functions are pure and without any side-effect. Among other things, it means that given the same arguments, a function will always return the same result. That’s why <code class="highlighter-rouge">Math.random</code> is a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Task</code>, because it isn’t pure. Using <code class="highlighter-rouge">Native</code>, you can make it synchronous. We will see the example just below but never do that in your project, I just want to show you that it is possible.</p>

<h2 id="tasks">Tasks</h2>

<p>Tasks are a huge part of any Elm program so it’s very likely that at some point, you will need to create them inside Native code. This is super useful for wrapping async Node functions. We will use other Elm helpers to achieve that. The main one is <code class="highlighter-rouge">_elm_lang$core$Native_Scheduler</code> which is responsible for creating and finishing, either with a success or a failure, any tasks inside Native code.</p>

<p>First, we will call the <code class="highlighter-rouge">nativeBinding</code> method of the scheduler. This will actually create an Elm task. But we need to give it a function as its first and only argument. This function will take a callback that you should call when your task is finished. This is how you can handle asynchronous tasks. You must wrap the result inside either the <code class="highlighter-rouge">succeed</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">fail</code> methods of the scheduler.</p>

<p>Remember that Tasks are not only for asynchronous code. Any non-pure function, like <code class="highlighter-rouge">Math.random</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">Date.now</code>, should also be a Task.</p>

<p>Did you notice that <code class="highlighter-rouge">now</code> is not a function? You don’t have to expose only functions in the returned API from a Native module, you can put whatever you want in it as long as you correctly use it inside your Elm code. Here, we directly create the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Task</code> which is a wrapper around our actual code. It will be called using <code class="highlighter-rouge">Task.perform</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">Task.attempt</code> later inside our program.</p>

<h2 id="the-end">The end</h2>

<p>This is it for the basics. I will try to write another post about the syntax of the JavaScript compiled file next and about more advanced stuff.</p>

    <h3 id="tldr">tl;dr</h3>

<p>Do not use <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm update</code> with any package which use custom dist-tags.</p>

<h3 id="dist-tags">Dist-tags</h3>

<p>This package has officially those 3 last versions: <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.0</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.1</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.2</code>. But inside the <code class="highlighter-rouge">dist-tags</code> (<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag">read more</a>), we have two of them: the classic <code class="highlighter-rouge">latest</code> which refers to the latest stable release of the package and a custom one, named <code class="highlighter-rouge">canary</code>, indicating the last non-stable release of the package. If you are wondering if real projects are using such tags, the answer is <strong>yes</strong>, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm</code> package is using <code class="highlighter-rouge">latest</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">next</code> tags for it’s weekly pre-release (<a href="https://github.com/npm/npm/wiki/Release-Process">read more</a>).</p>

<p>Currently, <code class="highlighter-rouge">latest</code> points to <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.1</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">canary</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.2</code>. Meaning that if you run <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm view test-npm-update</code>, you will have something like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="s2">"name"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"test-npm-update"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">

  </span><span class="s2">"versions"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"1.0.0"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"1.0.1"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"1.0.2"</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="s2">"version"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"1.0.1"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="versions">Versions</h3>

<p>It’s important to realize a few things here. <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.2</code> is a released version just as <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.0</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.1</code> and we will say it’s the <strong>greatest</strong> one (as in the biggest number according to semver) but not the <strong>latest</strong> one (as in the one tagged with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">latest</code> dist-tag). We need to make such distinction to fully understand what will happen after that.</p>

<p>So, when you run <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm view test-npm-update</code>, it actually runs <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm view test-npm-update@latest</code>, meaning it will grab the informations of the <strong>latest</strong> version. But maybe some other versions have been released with a custom tag after this one. For me, so far, so good. NPM is doing exactly what I would expect. If I want a custom release such as the canary one, I can run <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm view test-npm-update@canary</code> and it will display infos about the <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.2</code> version. In fact, but I might be wrong but I except NPM to always use the <strong>latest</strong> version (aka the <code class="highlighter-rouge">latest</code> dist-tag) by default if I don’t specify anything. That’s what you can mostly read all over the NPM documentation.</p>

<p>But remember, <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.2</code> is inside the <code class="highlighter-rouge">versions</code> array just like any other version. So first warning, if you use such metadata for whatever stuff you are doing, do not assume that the <strong>greatest</strong> version inside the <code class="highlighter-rouge">versions</code> array is the <strong>latest</strong> one.</p>

<h3 id="install">Install</h3>

<p>Now, what if I run <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm install test-npm-update</code>? What would you expect to be installed? <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.1</code> right? And of course it will be this version, the <strong>latest</strong> one. That’s normal, after all, <strong>latest</strong> is the default one. All good here.</p>

<p>What if I clean my folder and then run <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm install test-npm-update@^1.0.0</code>? Guess what, <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.1</code> will be installed. And I’m totally ok with that. I asked for the best 1.x.x version and I’m glad to have the <strong>latest</strong> one since it matches.</p>

<h3 id="packagejson">package.json</h3>

<p>But most of the time, you don’t install or update from command line, you have a <code class="highlighter-rouge">package.json</code> file with a range inside it. Let’s say we have the following one:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="s2">"name"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"awesome-project"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="s2">"version"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"0.0.0"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="s2">"dependencies"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="s2">"test-npm-update"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"^1.0.0"</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Pretty classic, right? Now, for the purpose of the demo, let’s say we currently have the <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.0</code> version of <code class="highlighter-rouge">test-npm-update</code> locally installed. If you want to reproduce, just create an empty folder, then create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">package.json</code> inside it with the previous content and run <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm install test-npm-update@1.0.0</code> to force the install of an old version.</p>

<p>Done? Cool, let’s move forward. NPM has a command to test if you have outdated versions locally installed. Which is our case. Let’s check that by running <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm outdated</code>. You should have something like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">Package          Current  Wanted  Latest  Location
<span class="nb">test</span>-npm-update  1.0.0    1.0.2   1.0.1</code></pre></figure>

<p>Wait a minute? I’m ok with <em>current</em> (the locally installed) being <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.0</code> and <em>latest</em> (matching the dist-tag) being <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.1</code> but <em>wanted</em> is supposed to be the best matching version I should install according to <code class="highlighter-rouge">package.json</code>. How can it be greater than <em>latest</em>?</p>

<p>Actually, it’s all ok according to the NPM documentation. After all, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">package.json</code> range is <code class="highlighter-rouge">^1.0.0</code> which means the greatest possible version without changing the first non-zero digit. And among <strong>all</strong> our versions (see the <code class="highlighter-rouge">versions</code> array from <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm view</code>), both <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.1</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.2</code> match this range, but since <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.2</code> is greater than <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.1</code>, the <em>wanted</em> version is <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.2</code>.</p>

<p>I didn’t expect that to be honest. That’s not wrong but I can’t help myself finding that strange.</p>

<h3 id="install-again">Install again</h3>

<p>Quick mention to the fact that if I run <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm install</code> with my <code class="highlighter-rouge">package.json</code> in an empty folder (aka without the <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.0</code> version already installed), it will still install <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.1</code> version. That’s ok according to <strong>latest</strong> being the default one. Back to our outdated <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.0</code> version.</p>

<h3 id="update">Update</h3>

<p>Things start to get really ugly now. So, <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm outdated</code> just told me I have an old local version. I should probably update it, and NPM has a command for that. Let’s run <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm update</code>. To be honest, I wasn’t sure anymore what would be installed locally. I mean, I would have normally expected the <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.1</code> version. My brain was like “It should be the greatest <strong>stable</strong> version which match the range”, with <strong>stable</strong> meaning lower or equal to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">latest</code> tag, but for NPM, it’s more like “It should be the greatest version which match the range. Period.”. And it makes all the difference. My brain stops at <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.1</code> as the latest stable but NPM browse <strong>all</strong> version, including any custom dist-tags, including the <code class="highlighter-rouge">canary</code> version.</p>

<p>At the end, running <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm update</code> will install <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.2</code> version. This is <strong>wrong</strong>. According to <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/update">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This command will update all the packages listed to the latest version (specified by the tag config), respecting semver.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read that as the <strong>latest</strong> version according to <code class="highlighter-rouge">latest</code> dist-tag. But we just updated to a version beyond this <strong>latest</strong> version. In any case, this is super dangerous! It means you can update to non-stable versions without even noticing it.</p>

<p>What if we didn’t have the <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.0</code> already installed? Since <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm update</code> also install missing packages, it will indeed install <code class="highlighter-rouge">test-npm-update</code> according to <code class="highlighter-rouge">package.json</code> and, of course, to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0.2</code> version.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>IMHO, I think this is way too dangerous, <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm update</code> should be capped by the <strong>latest</strong> version, and so should <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm outdated</code>. By default, no command should target versions beyond <code class="highlighter-rouge">latest</code> dist-tag. Also, it seems inconsistent to have <code class="highlighter-rouge">install</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">update</code> both capable of installing a missing package from a <code class="highlighter-rouge">package.json</code> file but not to the same version.</p>

<p>I raised an issue on <a href="https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8476">Github</a>, we will see. Be careful from now on.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading! Spread the word.</p>

<h3 id="personal-ad">Personal ad</h3>

<p>It might be a bit too early to speak about that, but if you need an <code class="highlighter-rouge">outdated</code> command which is actually capped by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">latest</code> tag and also support other package managers (like Bower), please check my <a href="https://github.com/pauldijou/outdated">outdated</a> project. It’s not ready at all yet but it will be in the next few days, promise.</p>

    <h3 id="tldr-coz-im-a-h4k3r">TL;DR ‘coz I’m a h4k3r</h3>

<p>Full source code of the demo is <a href="https://github.com/blogsamples/play-browserSync">on GitHub</a> with a nice and simple README on how to bootstrap the project.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-you-talking-about-dude">What are you talking about dude?</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.playframework.com">Play Framework</a> is an HTTP server written in Scala. It is super cool and you should probably give it a try. Let’s say you are using it, you really enjoy how productive it is, only having to refresh your browser to see all your code modifications, but you want to go further, you want live-reloading! There are several tools doing that.</p>

<p>Introducing <a href="http://www.browsersync.io">BrowserSync</a>. It provides 2 killers features. One is live-reloading: it can monitor resources, and when it detects some modifications, it will reload the browser page to load them. Even better, if possible, it will hot deploy them, meaning they will be loaded without reloading the page. That’s the case for CSS files which are loaded and the page repainted to display the new design without any refresh. The second one is to keep synchronized several browsers across devices. And we are not talking about resources only but about all user actions. If you scroll on one browser, it will scroll on all connected browsers, same for clicking on a button, and so on…</p>

<p>Let me say it again with a concrete example. You are on your computer, one screen with your source code, another one with Chrome opened and a last one with Firefox. You also have an iPad tablet and an Android smartphone connected to your computer. All of those have your application main page opened. Each time your edit your code, they will all reload and display the new result (hot deploy in case of CSS). When you are ready to test interactions, you just go to, let’s say, your Chrome browser and start scrolling and clicking. All your screens will start moving and doing the actions everywhere. Talk about increasing productivity!!</p>

<p>What about assets that require compilation? Such as SCSS, LESS, Stylus, CoffeeScript, etc… No biggy bro (or sis), we have you covered. In this demo, we will use <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> to monitor those resources, compile them, and pass them to BrowserSync for live-reloading (obviously not losing the hot deploy if possible). You can freely use whatever build tool you want, be it Grunt, Broccoli, …</p>

<h3 id="magic-proxy">Magic proxy</h3>

<p>BrowserSync could be used as the web server, that’s the easiest way to use it, and I’m actually doing it when my Play server is only here to provide a REST API. Consider doing that when you don’t need Scala templates or when you cannot use them (for example if you want to embed all your standalone HTML files inside a Cordova / PhoneGap application).</p>

<p>But here, we want to use Play as the web server, meaning it will be responsible to serve all our assets: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For that, we will need to use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">proxy</code> feature of BrowserSync. Long story short, it will start another web server, on its own port, and will display the exact content from the Play server but adding a bit of JavaScript magic in it so it can enable all its features. It is just like opening your Play application, just on a different port. By default, you would use the port <code class="highlighter-rouge">9000</code> for Play, in this demo, we will set the proxy on port <code class="highlighter-rouge">9001</code> (it would have been around <code class="highlighter-rouge">3000</code> by default, but I didn’t want anyone to freak out so I put it as close as possible to Play default one).</p>

<p>We also want to live-reload some of our resources. I kept it simple for this demo, but you are free to add as many as your want. We will use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">files</code> property of BrowserSync configuration and set and array of files to monitor (it supports wildcards). Here, we are monitoring all CSS files from <code class="highlighter-rouge">public/stylesheets</code>, JavaScript files from <code class="highlighter-rouge">public/javascripts</code> and HTML files from  <code class="highlighter-rouge">app/views</code>. There are two important points to notice here. First, we are referencing files based on their path on the source code, not on their actual url. For example, <code class="highlighter-rouge">public/stylesheets/main.css</code> will be served by Play as <code class="highlighter-rouge">assets/stylesheets/main.css</code>, but BrowserSync only needs to know the real path, after that, you can map it to whatever url you want. Second, we are monitoring Scala templates, and it’s fine because when BrowserSync will detect a modification, it will reload the page, and Play will re-compile the template before serving it, so it will display the new version. It works just fine with both <code class="highlighter-rouge">run</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">~run</code> , the latest being faster.</p>

<p>Here is a super small configuration for BrowserSync to enable such a proxy. You can read the <a href="http://www.browsersync.io/docs/options/">online documentation</a> to extend it.</p>

<p>Right… right… there are assets that you cannot serve directly, you need to preprocess them. The easiest way to do that is using a build tool, just pick one among the best ones (Gulp, Grunt, Broccoli, Brunch, …) and enjoy. There is a really simple separation of concern here: the build tool only manage assets that are not served directly (LESS, CoffeeScript, …) and compile them into assets that are actually handled by BrowserSync (CSS, JavaScript, images, …) which then live-reload them.</p>

<p>It’s so easy that it’s nearly frustrating. In the demo, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">main.css</code> file is generated from <code class="highlighter-rouge">main.less</code>. I have two Gulp task to handle that: one for compilation and one to monitor any modification.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">gulp</span>        <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'gulp'</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="c1">// Registering a 'less' task that just compile our LESS files to CSS</span>
<span class="nx">gulp</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">task</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'less'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<h3 id="wait-where-are-sbt-web-and-webjars">Wait, where are sbt-web and webjars?</h3>

<p>Yeaaaaah… so lately, Play has introduced all those stuff on managing assets using SBT, some plugins and webjars. It works just fine but for me, it’s just as strange as if I would install Play from NPM. It’s cool if people want to try to merge two super different worlds (front-end and back-end), be it Node.js or scala.js, but I’m totally not ready for that. As a full stack developer, I want to enjoy each world with its own ecosystem, not trying to bend one into the other.</p>

<p>That’s why in all my projects, front-end assets are handled by front-end tooling (mostly Gulp and NPM lately) and my back-end resources by back-end tools (SBT, Ivy, Maven, …). Not only do I get the best of each, but I do not have some limitations. For example, the other day, I came across a bug on a JavaScript library I was using. No biggy: fork the repo, correct the bug, do a pull request. And while waiting for the author to merge it (which can take some time), I am free to directly use my fork inside my <code class="highlighter-rouge">package.json</code> so it’s not blocking at all. It tooks me less than an hour. I would be curious on how to do that using webjars? Anyway, sorry for not planning any proof of concept using webjars if that’s what you are using.</p>

<p>And that’s it! As I said at the beginning of the article, the demo is <a href="https://github.com/blogsamples/play-browserSync">on GitHub</a>, feel free to clone and play with it. Enjoy and thanks for reading.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Once again, I will not explain what <a href="http://prismic.io">prismic.io</a> is (but it’s a tool to manage your website content), I will only focus on one limitation and how to solve it. If you don’t know about prismic.io, you should quickly check its website before reading any further.</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-problem">What’s the problem?</h3>

<p>In prismic.io, you are creating Documents which are composed of Fragments. A fragment is data organized in a more or less semantic way. For example, a fragment can be a Number, or a Date, … Among them, there is the type Image which is really nice because you can not only fully resize / crop your raw picture, but also add smaller images based on the original one for responsive purpose. You can upload your awesome photo of this beautiful sunset, fully sized at 4000 x 3000 pixels, resize it for desktop at 1920 x 1080, and finally add a mobile version at 320 * 480. Note that the last one doesn’t respect the ratio at all, but that’s the goal: you are creating a subset of your image with the best match possible regarding the targeted screen.</p>

<p>Another really powerful fragment in prismic is the StructuredText. It allows you to have a nice WYSIWYG editor inside which you will put new fragments (paragraphs, links, titles, images, …). It would be perfect if the image fragment inside a StructuredText was a real Image fragment, but it is not. You cannot specify any thumbnail. Meaning your content cannot be responsive at all. Your choice is: consume all the bandwith for mobiles with awesome full HD images or make the eyes of your desktop users bleed with super compressed images.</p>

<h3 id="you-dont-want-to-do-that">You don’t want to do that!</h3>

<p>And me neither! I want to have responsive images inside my StructuredText for God sake. I love tools which make my life easier, but they never should stand on my way to craft the best website possible. I will not lie to you, I couldn’t find any solution that integrates nicely with the WYSIWYG editor since there is no way to extend it. The following solution will be a bit of hacking and your writers might complain about it at first.</p>

<p>So, what’s the idea? The only way to have responsive images is to use a real Image fragment, no choice here. So let’s create one, and let’s put it inside a Group fragment. This way, you can add and remove as many images as you want and they will all be responsive. Wait, you can’t do that inside the StructuredText, right? Indeed, that’s why we will do outside of it and then find a way to bring back the images inside of it. Here is the mask for such a group:</p>

<p class="alert alert-info"><strong>Pro Tip</strong> - When creating thumbnails for an Image fragment, the <a href="https://developers.prismic.io/documentation/UjBeuLGIJ3EKtgBV/repository-administrators-manual#document-masks">offical documentation</a> states that both width and height are mandatory. This is <strong>wrong</strong>, you can specify only one of the two or even none of them. Your UI might be a bit ugly (the resized thumbnails will only display after saving your draft) and sometimes you will have to click twice on a button (this one, I really don’t understand) but otherwise, it works just fine. I hope prismic guys will make those attributes optional because… well… how can you anticipate how the writer wants to resize its image?</p>

<p>As you can see, I added two more fields. One is <code class="highlighter-rouge">name</code> and we will use it to reference our images inside the StructuredText. The other one is <code class="highlighter-rouge">caption</code>, that’s because I want to put one on my images but prismic didn’t allow me to do that at all by default. Thanks God, using this solution, I can finally do it, killing two birds with one stone. Now we can add as many responsive images as we want, yeah! Let’s grab some orange juice to celebrate!</p>

<h3 id="lets-hack-some-html">Let’s hack some HTML</h3>

<p>As I already said it, the next step will be to bring those images inside the StructuredText. We cannot do that directly inside the WYSIWYG editor but we can do it when rendering the final HTML. We will need two more things here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>having a placeholder inside the StructuredText to indicate we should insert an image</li>
  <li>extend the default HTML renderer to support such placeholder</li>
</ul>

<p>As for the placeholder, I decided to use a simple format like <code class="highlighter-rouge">{image-[name of the image]}</code>. Meaning that if the content of a paragraph inside my StructuredText is <code class="highlighter-rouge">{image-sunset}</code>, it will actually render the image named <code class="highlighter-rouge">sunset</code> from the group of images when generating the final HTML. Pretty easy right? Your writers might find it ugly, having to write those strange tags, and not seeing their images directly inside the StructuredText, but just tell them that’s for the greater good. You could, of course, use another syntax, eventually support attributes, whatever.</p>

<p>The final task, and probably the hardest one, is to extend the HTML rendering system. Each primisc fragment has its own way to render as HTML. Unfortunately, there is no way to extend it, you can only, eventually, override it. And the one for StructuredText is by far the most complex one. The easiest way to do that is to copy/paste the default one from the kit you are using (if you are not using any kit, you are free to do whatever you want, so it’s fine) and edit it. You will then edit the part responsible for rendering a paragraph, test if its content match our placeholder syntax, if so, render an image, if not, just render the text as it is. Since I’m using the JavaScript kit, here is the <a href="https://github.com/pauldijou/farewell/blob/9a744565d7e66f06aa9a3edf7e360db0f00c70aa/scripts/prismic.js#L65-L159">full copy/paste</a> but that’s the <a href="https://github.com/pauldijou/farewell/blob/9a744565d7e66f06aa9a3edf7e360db0f00c70aa/scripts/prismic.js#L105-L117">important part</a> where we are rendering the image. My <code class="highlighter-rouge">model</code> is actually a JavaScript class extracted from the original prismic Document, but you could use the raw Document of course.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion-and-limitations">Conclusion and limitations</h3>

<p>That’s pretty much it. Here is a quick summary of what to do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>inside the mask, add a Group of Images with, at least, a Text fragment for the name.</li>
  <li>choose a naming convention to write placeholders inside a StructuredText, ex: <code class="highlighter-rouge">{image-[name]}</code></li>
  <li>override the StructuredText HTML rendering function with a custom one inserting images from the Document when finding a placeholder</li>
  <li>you can add more attributes and render them (like a caption)</li>
</ul>

<p>What are the bad points / limitations of the solution?</p>

<ul>
  <li>writers need to write placeholders rather than having a nice UI to insert images</li>
  <li>images do not display natively in the WYSIWYG editor anymore</li>
  <li>you cannot re-order a Group fragment right now, meaning images will be sorted based on their created date and not on their place inside the StructuredText</li>
</ul>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Last week, on Wednesday, I had a meeting with some colleagues at <a href="//movio.co">Movio</a> about the <a href="http://scaladownunder.org">Scala Downunder</a> conference. It’s a Scala conference in Auckland, New Zealand, with speakers from Typesafe and local ones, and some replay from Scala Days. I discovered that we were doing the website for the conference here at Movio, and also that it was due for the following Friday in order to send it to Typesafe for feedback…. Ah, and also I would be crafting it.</p>

<p>(Pssst… okay, there has been some commits on the repo after the deadline, but that’s only because the schedule totally changed, not my fault!)</p>

<h3 id="lets-get-started">Let’s get started!</h3>

<p>So, deadline is 2 days from now, the website is only one long page with all classic stuff: presentation, speakers, schedule, location and sponsors. Really good point: both the design and the content are nearly fully done. Otherwise, it would have been impossible.</p>

<p>My first step was to pick my tooling. I truly hate copy/pasting anything so it was out of question to copy/paste HTML when it comes to iterable data. I needed a static HTML website generator. Since the plan was to publish it on GitHub Pages, I choose <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. This way, I would have the build for free, only needing to push on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> branch my source code (at the end, that didn’t work at all, but Jekyll is still a good choice). Bootstraping with Jekyll is super fast as long as you already have Ruby installed on your machine.</p>

<p>Next I picked <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> as my build tool. I love both <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> and Gulp, but I’m trying to be more familiar with Gulp lately (at some point, I will switch to <a href="https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli">Broccoli</a> anyway). Here is one <strong>important point</strong>: you should have snippets for each Gulp (or Grunt) task ready somewhere so you can do your setup in minutes. For example, here, I wanted to use <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> as CSS preprocessor, <a href="http://browserify.org/">Browserify</a> for JavaScript packaging and <a href="http://www.browsersync.io/">BrowserSync</a> for live-reloading. I already got all those snippets, so I just needed to copy/paste them once in order to have my server running live and compiling all my assets.</p>

<h3 id="be-semantic-with-your-content">Be semantic with your content</h3>

<p>Remember, what’s the most important is your content, not the design nor the funky JavaScript effects. And don’t try to rush to apply funny colors or amazing transitions before having a real content behind them or you might not see the real behaviour when implementing them. Since I already have it, I wrote only HTML during the first hour. It allows me to be 100% semantic with my content. I don’t care about CSS selectors or whatever, if this is a paragraph, I create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;p&gt;</code> tag, if this is a section, let’s use a <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;section&gt;</code> tag. And at the end, you can already see the 0.0.1 version of you website, fully “usable” (just a bit ugly, and tons of typos).</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/2014-07-30/downunder001.png" alt="downunder001" /></p>

<p>After that, I worked to all dynamic parts of my HTML. I really wanted to have full content before starting doing any LESS. I used the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_data</code> folder of Jekyll that allow me to structured data in YAML files. I put all speakers and schedule in it. After that, it’s all about the <a href="http://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-documentation/basics">Liquid templating</a> system to render it. You have <code class="highlighter-rouge">for</code> loops and <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code> blocks, you have filers to render Markdown or whatever, for such a simple website, it was more than enough.</p>

<p>At this point, we are something like nearly half a day in the project and we have all the content and a nice setup allowing us to be super productive. It could have been faster, but there was quite some content to write and it took me a bit more time than planned to implement all my templating. That’s cool!</p>

<h3 id="do-it-with-style">Do it with style</h3>

<p>As you can image, the next step is doing all the website design. If possible, I prefer to write all CSS classes first, staying close to the HTML semantic and then implement them rather than inventing crazy CSS selectors and then bind them to your HTML. It’s important to know what’s your browser target. Because, trust me, you want to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">flexbox</code> but that means IE10+ (using a LESS mixins for old syntax). Lucky me, I could do that. If not, consider using a grid system.</p>

<p>When doing the design, never <strong>ever</strong> think “Oh, it looks already pretty good… I shouldn’t be far away from the end”. There is this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a> that apply a lot to CSS in my opinion. It means that in just two hours, I had a decent design, but in the and, it costs me a full day to have the final thing. Why? Because after having done the main style, you will start testing on other browsers, on other devices, find small bugs, and spend way too much time to correct them. Also, at some point, if you can, you should review the website with the designer, and this is vital but sometime really hard. He will probably want to reach pixel perfection and nobody can blame him for that, take time and probably some refactoring, and also some hacks. At the end, you will have spent 20% of your time having a nice (but not perfect) design on Chrome, and 80% having a pixel perfect design on most modern browsers, being responsive, and having a decent fallback on old ones.</p>

<p>It was a pretty simple design so it was quite straightforward. Just remember you can do magic with pseudo-elements. I use them a lot for all those forms (circles, traits, …). Flexbox is doing an awesome job to overcome old CSS limitations (Who said vertical align?) and being responsive. This way, I didn’t have do use any open-source CSS project except for my reset, using the awesome <a href="http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">normalize.css</a>.</p>

<p>I also decided to use pure SVG rather than a font for my icons. This decision was based on reading great articles from Chris Coyier, like <a href="http://css-tricks.com/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts/">this one</a>, <a href="http://css-tricks.com/svg-symbol-good-choice-icons/">that one</a> and finally <a href="http://css-tricks.com/icon-fonts-vs-svg/">this battle one</a>. All worked fine.</p>

<h3 id="finish-the-script">Finish the script</h3>

<p>During the last half day, I focused on writing the small JavaScript needed for the website. There really wasn’t much of it: double sticky navigation bar, nice scrolling between sections and modal panel for each talk description. Let’s be honest, since I am targeting IE10+, I totally didn’t need jQuery. But if you check the source code, you will find it. Why? I was starting to run out of time and I really wanted to use some nice plugins to leverage all the grunt work. Also, using one of the last version of jQuery, it will be fast enough and will not add too much of a payload. So… it’s fine.</p>

<p>I finally had the chance to use <a href="http://julian.com/research/velocity/">Velocity</a>, a jQuery plugin for animations. It works just great, super fast even on mobile. You should try it. It powers both the scrolling and the modal animation. For the stick navs, I choose the <a href="http://stickyjs.com/">Sticky plugin</a> which is simple and great. Nothing more to add. I packaged all that stuff with Browserify, but more because I love this tool rather than because it was needed.</p>

<h3 id="going-further">Going further</h3>

<p>So, why didn’t it work to only push to <code class="highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code>? It did at first, but then I started to use more complex features with Jekyll 2.x and, guess what? GitHub Pages still use a 1.x Jekyll version, so it didn’t match. Also, I wanted to do post generation stuff, like <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-usemin">usemin</a> to minify all my assets and append then with a hash version, also updating the index HTML file. I just had to wrote a simple <a href="https://github.com/movio/scala-downunder/blob/master/_gulp/deploy.js">deploy script</a> in order to overcome the problem.</p>

<p>I don’t really want to go through all the details, but you can see the <a href="http://scaladownunder.org/">final result</a>, read the <a href="https://github.com/movio/scala-downunder">full source code</a>, and here are a few highlights:</p>
